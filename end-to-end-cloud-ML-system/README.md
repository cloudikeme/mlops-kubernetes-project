This project will demonstrate your skills in model development, deployment, monitoring, and automation. We'll break it down into steps and create the necessary components. For this example, we'll use Python, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and some popular open-source tools.





# MLOps Portfolio Project: End-to-End ML System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline, including model training, deployment, monitoring, and automated retraining. The system uses a dataset from Kaggle to train a machine learning model and provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions and adding new data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit (Frontend)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  - Google Compute Engine (VM)
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Cloud Functions
  - Google Cloud Run
  - BigQuery
- scikit-learn (ML model)
- FastAPI (API endpoints)
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Grafana (Monitoring dashboard)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation and Model Training**
   - Choose a simple dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Iris dataset or Boston Housing)
   - Implement data preprocessing and model training in `model/train.py`
   - Use scikit-learn for initial model development

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Create a Streamlit app in `frontend/app.py`
   - Implement forms for data input and prediction display
   - Add functionality to submit new data for retraining

3. **API Development**
   - Create a FastAPI application in `api/main.py`
   - Implement endpoints for predictions and data ingestion
   - Dockerize the API for deployment on Cloud Run

4. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**
   - Use Terraform to set up GCP resources (VM, Storage, BigQuery)
   - Configure Google Cloud Storage for model artifact storage
   - Set up BigQuery for storing prediction data and monitoring metrics

5. **MLOps Pipeline Development**
   - Implement data ingestion pipeline (`pipelines/data_ingestion.py`)
   - Create model training pipeline (`pipelines/model_training.py`)
   - Develop model evaluation pipeline (`pipelines/model_evaluation.py`)
   - Build model deployment pipeline (`pipelines/model_deployment.py`)

6. **Monitoring and Dashboard Setup**
   - Configure BigQuery to store prediction data and model performance metrics
   - Set up Grafana dashboard for visualizing model performance and data drift
   - Implement alerts for performance degradation or data drift

7. **Automated Retraining and Deployment**
   - Use Google Cloud Functions to trigger retraining on new data
   - Implement model evaluation checks before deployment
   - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Write unit tests for model and API functionality
   - Implement integration tests for the entire pipeline
   - Set up continuous integration to run tests on every commit

9. **Documentation and Readme**
   - Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
   - Document the architecture, design decisions, and potential improvements

10. **Performance Optimization (Bonus)**
    - Profile API response times and identify bottlenecks
    - Implement caching strategies to reduce latency
    - Optimize model inference time (e.g., model quantization, TensorRT)
    - Document the performance improvement process and results

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment and create the project structure
2. Begin implementing each component, starting with the model training and frontend
3. Gradually build out the cloud infrastructure and MLOps pipelines
4. Integrate all components and test the end-to-end functionality
5. Optimize performance and document the entire process

This project will showcase your ability to build a complete, production-ready ML system with automated training, deployment, and monitoring capabilities.


I've created a comprehensive project structure and implementation plan for your MLOps portfolio project. This project covers all the aspects you mentioned, including:

1. A Streamlit frontend for data input and predictions
2. Cloud-based ML model training and API endpoints
3. Prediction storage and monitoring dashboard
4. Automated pipelines for data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment
5. Continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions

To get started with this project, you should:

1. Set up your GCP account and install necessary tools (gcloud CLI, Terraform)
2. Create a new GitHub repository with the structure outlined in the artifact
3. Begin implementing each component, starting with the model training script and Streamlit frontend
4. Gradually build out the cloud infrastructure using Terraform
5. Develop the API and MLOps pipelines
6. Set up monitoring and dashboards
7. Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment

Would you like me to help you get started with any specific part of this project, such as setting up the initial model training script or creating the Streamlit frontend?
