Certainly! Let's adapt the project to use Kubernetes and open-source tools instead of relying heavily on cloud-specific services. This approach will make the project more portable across different cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure.





# MLOps Portfolio Project: Kubernetes-based ML System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline using Kubernetes and open-source tools. It includes model training, deployment, monitoring, and automated retraining. The system uses a dataset from Kaggle to train a machine learning model and provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions and adding new data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Streamlit (Frontend)
- FastAPI (API endpoints)
- MLflow (Experiment tracking and model registry)
- Kubeflow Pipelines (ML workflows)
- Prometheus and Grafana (Monitoring)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- MinIO (Object storage)
- Argo CD (GitOps deployment)
- Seldon Core (Model serving)
- Istio (Service mesh)
- GitLab CI/CD (or GitHub Actions)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using minikube for local development or a managed Kubernetes service)
   - Install necessary tools: kubectl, helm, istioctl

2. **Data Preparation and Model Training**
   - Choose a simple dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Iris dataset or Boston Housing)
   - Implement data preprocessing and model training in `model/train.py`
   - Use scikit-learn for initial model development
   - Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Create a Streamlit app in `frontend/app.py`
   - Implement forms for data input and prediction display
   - Add functionality to submit new data for retraining
   - Dockerize the frontend application

4. **API Development**
   - Create a FastAPI application in `api/main.py`
   - Implement endpoints for predictions and data ingestion
   - Dockerize the API

5. **Kubernetes Deployment Configurations**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for each component (frontend, API, MLflow, PostgreSQL, MinIO)
   - Set up Istio for traffic management and security
   - Configure Seldon Core for model serving

6. **MLOps Pipeline Development**
   - Implement Kubeflow Pipelines for:
     - Data ingestion (`pipelines/data_ingestion.py`)
     - Model training (`pipelines/model_training.py`)
     - Model evaluation (`pipelines/model_evaluation.py`)
     - Model deployment (`pipelines/model_deployment.py`)
   - Use MLflow for model versioning and tracking

7. **Monitoring and Dashboard Setup**
   - Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Set up Grafana dashboards for visualizing model performance and system metrics
   - Implement custom metrics for model performance and data drift

8. **Automated Retraining and Deployment**
   - Use Kubeflow Pipelines to trigger retraining on new data
   - Implement model evaluation checks before deployment
   - Use Argo CD for GitOps-style continuous deployment

9. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Write unit tests for model and API functionality
   - Implement integration tests for the entire pipeline
   - Set up continuous integration to run tests on every commit

10. **GitOps and CI/CD**
    - Use GitLab CI/CD (or GitHub Actions) for continuous integration
    - Implement GitOps practices using Argo CD for deploying to Kubernetes

11. **Documentation and Readme**
    - Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
    - Document the architecture, design decisions, and potential improvements

12. **Performance Optimization (Bonus)**
    - Profile API response times and identify bottlenecks
    - Implement horizontal pod autoscaling for the API and model serving components
    - Optimize model inference time (e.g., model quantization, ONNX runtime)
    - Document the performance improvement process and results

## Next Steps

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster and install necessary tools
2. Begin implementing each component, starting with the model training and frontend
3. Create Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for deploying components
4. Gradually build out the MLOps pipelines using Kubeflow
5. Integrate all components and test the end-to-end functionality
6. Set up monitoring, logging, and observability
7. Implement GitOps practices and CI/CD pipelines
8. Optimize performance and document the entire process

This Kubernetes-based project will showcase your ability to build a complete, production-ready ML system using cloud-native technologies and open-source tools. It demonstrates skills in containerization, orchestration, MLOps, and DevOps practices.


I've updated the project structure and implementation plan to focus on Kubernetes and open-source tools. This new approach offers several advantages:

1. **Portability**: The system can run on any Kubernetes cluster, whether it's on-premises or in any cloud provider.
2. **Scalability**: Kubernetes provides built-in scaling capabilities for handling increased load.
3. **Flexibility**: Using open-source tools allows for easier customization and avoids vendor lock-in.
4. **Industry-relevance**: Many companies are adopting Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies, making this skillset highly valuable.

Key changes in this version include:

1. Replacing cloud-specific services with open-source alternatives (e.g., MinIO for object storage, PostgreSQL for database)
2. Using Kubeflow Pipelines for ML workflows instead of cloud-specific pipeline tools
3. Implementing Seldon Core for model serving, which integrates well with Kubernetes
4. Adding Istio for advanced networking features and security
5. Using Argo CD for GitOps-style continuous deployment

To get started with this Kubernetes-based project:

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster (you can use minikube for local development)
2. Install necessary tools: kubectl, helm, istioctl
3. Create a new Git repository with the structure outlined in the artifact
4. Begin implementing the core components (model training, frontend, API)
5. Create Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for deploying components
6. Gradually build out the MLOps pipelines using Kubeflow
7. Set up monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana
8. Implement CI/CD pipelines and GitOps practices

Would you like me to help you get started with any specific part of this Kubernetes-based project, such as setting up the initial Kubernetes manifests or creating the model training script with MLflow integration?
